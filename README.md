## Dependencies
**Python 2.7**

**Mac Installation**  
Method 1: Package Installer  

1. Go to the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) that contains downloads for the most recent versions of Python.
2. If you are using Mac OS X 10.6 or later, download [the installer linked from that page](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12-macosx10.6.pkg). If you are using 10.5, you will need an alternate installer, the [32-bit i386/PPC installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12-macosx10.5.pkg).
3. Open the file that you downloaded. It should either be called `python-2.7.12-macosx10.6.pkg` or `python-2.7.12-macosx10.5.pkg`. Note: The images below show Python 2.7.9, but the process is unchanged in more recent versions.
4. Follow the steps in the Python Installer to successfully install Python.
5. To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE, a program installed by Python that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.
  * It should be in your Applications folder.
  * You can also use Spotlight by pressing âŒ˜+Space and typing in "idle" to find it.

Method 2: Homebrew  
To install Python via Homebrew, there are only two steps:

1. Open up your terminal and enter the following command: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`. You will be prompted several times during the installation process.
2. When you're done installing Homebrew, you can verify everything worked by typing the `brew help` command at the command line. Now, just type `brew install python` to get the latest version of Python 2.

**Windows Installation**  

1. Navigate to the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) that indexes downloads for the most recent versions of Python. This course was designed with Python 2 in mind so select that download.
2. Download the Windows x86 MSI installer. _If you're sure that your machine runs a 64-bit version of Windows, feel free to download the Windows x86-64 MSI installer instead._
3. Once the download is finished, locate the file (it'll probably be in your Downloads directory) and run it. Note: the images below show Python 2.7.9, but the process is the same for newer versions.
4. Follow the installation wizard. Let Python install to its default directory, `C:\Python27\`.
5. Ensure that both `pip` is installed and that Python is added to your `PATH`.
6. To confirm that your installation was successful, open IDLE, a program installed by Python that makes it easy to edit and run Python code.
  * Windows 7 (or earlier): Use the Start Menu to go to All Programs, then Python 2.7, and, finally, IDLE (Python GUI).
  * Windows 8: Search for IDLE. Currently, you can search by swiping from the right edge of the screen or by using the lower-right corner of your screen if you have a mouse.
